# Building a Todo App with ByteMason

This guide walks you through creating a full-stack todo application with authentication, categories, and due dates.

## Project Setup

```bash
# Create new project
berry new todo-app
cd todo-app

# Generate specification
berry plan "Create a todo app with user authentication, categories, and due dates. Users should be able to create, update, delete todos and organize them by categories. Each todo should have a title, description, due date, category, and completion status."
```

## Understanding the Generated Specification

The specification will include:

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Users table (handled by Supabase Auth)
   - Todos table
   - Categories table

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - CRUD operations for todos
   - Category management
   - User preferences

3. **UI Components**:
   - Authentication forms
   - Todo creation/edit forms
   - Category management
   - Todo list with filters

## Database Setup

```bash
# Configure Supabase
berry db setup ./spec/specification.json

# Push migrations
berry db push
```

## Code Generation

```bash
# Generate application code
berry code ./spec/specification.json
```

## Testing Your Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Build Errors**: Run `berry repair` to fix common issues
- **Database Sync**: Use `berry db push` after schema changes
- **UI Updates**: Modify shadcn components in `components/ui`
