# Introduction

Turn your ideas into full stack applications with AI-powered code generation.

## What is ByteMason?

ByteMason is an intelligent development tool that transforms natural language descriptions into complete full stack web applications. It's designed for both beginners and experienced developers who want to:

- Build full-stack Next.js applications quickly
- Automate repetitive development tasks

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Anthropic API key
- OpenAI API key


## Quick Start

We will be launching bytemason on pip soon as a package, for now you can use the repo.

```bash
# Install ByteMason
git clone https://github.com/lumiralabs/bytemason

# Create a .env file in root
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

# Run this to download all the dependencies
uv pip install -e .

# Create and generate your app
berry new <app-name>
cd <app-name>
berry plan <prompt>
berry db setup ./spec/specification.json
berry db push
berry code ./spec/specification.json
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

ByteMason uses a three-phase approach:

1. **Understanding and planning** - AI analyzes your requirements and generates detailed technical specifications.
2. **Building** - Creates Database schemas, frontend nad backend of your application
3. **Testing** - Tests and fixes all the compile time errors.

## Core Features

**AI-Powered Development**
- Natural language to code conversion
- Automatic error detection and fixing
- Smart code generation and repair

**Modern Stack**
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Supabase as Database and Auth provider
- TypeScript for type safety
- shadcn/ui components

**Developer Experience**
- Clean, maintainable code
- Automated testing setup
- Type-safe database queries
- Modern development patterns

## Local Development

Want to contribute or modify ByteMason? It's easy to get started:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/lumiralabs/bytemason.git
cd bytemason

# Create virtual environment (Python 3.10 or higher)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Set environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API keys to .env
```


## Best Practices

1. **Writing Effective Prompts**
   ```bash
   # Be specific about features
   berry plan "Build a blog with categories, tags, 
   comments, and email notifications for new posts"
   ```

2. **Working with Generated Code**
   - Review generated files
   - Make incremental changes
   - Use version control

3. **Database Management**
   - Review migrations
   - Test data relationships
   - Validate security rules
