# Understanding ByteMason's AI

ByteMason uses advanced AI to help you build applications. Let's understand how it works in simple terms.

## The Three AI Agents

ByteMason has three specialized AI agents working together to build your application:

### 1. Understanding Agent

This agent is like a skilled project manager who:

- Reads your project description
- Figures out what features you need
- Plans how everything should work together

For example, if you say:

```bash
mason plan "Build me a todo app with categories"
```

The Understanding Agent will identify:

- You need a todo list feature
- Todos should be organized in categories
- Users should be able to create, edit, and delete todos
- Each todo needs a title, description, and category

### 2. Code Generation Agent

Think of this agent as your expert developer who:

- Creates the database structure
- Writes React components
- Sets up API endpoints
- Implements authentication
- Adds necessary UI components

### 3. Repair Agent

This is like having a debugging expert who:

- Checks if the application builds correctly
- Identifies any errors or issues
- Fixes problems automatically
- Ensures everything works together

For example, if there's a missing import:

```typescript
// Before: Error - 'Button' is not defined
export function TodoActions() {
  return <Button>Add Todo</Button>;
}

// After: Fixed automatically
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
export function TodoActions() {
  return <Button>Add Todo</Button>;
}
```

## How They Work Together

1. **Planning Phase**

   - You describe what you want to build
   - Understanding Agent creates a detailed plan
   - You can review and adjust the plan

2. **Building Phase**

   - Code Generation Agent creates the application
   - Files are organized in a clean structure
   - UI components are added automatically

3. **Quality Check**
   - Repair Agent checks for compile time issues
   - Problems are fixed automatically
   - Application is ready to run

## Best Practices

To get the best results:

1. **Be Specific**

   ```bash
   # Less specific
   mason plan "Build me a todo app"

   # More specific
   mason plan "Build a todo app where users can create lists,
   add items with due dates, and share lists with other users"
   ```

2. **Review Generated Code**

   - Check the `app` directory for API routes and pages
   - Look at `components` for UI elements and logical components

3. **Customize Gradually**
   - Start with the generated code
   - Make small changes to match your needs
   - Use the repair command if needed:
     ```bash
     mason repair
     ```

## Understanding the Output

ByteMason generates a modern Next.js application with:

```
your-app/
├── app/                 # Next.js App Router pages
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
├── lib/                 # Utilities and API functions
└── public/              # Static assets
```

Each part is:

- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Connected to your Supabase database
- Ready for deployment
