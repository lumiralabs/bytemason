## Core Commands

### `mason new`

Creates a new ByteMason project by cloning a boilerplate with foundational logic already set up.

```bash
mason new <project-name>
```

> **Note**: From here all the following commands must be run inside the created project directory.

### `mason plan`

Uses AI to analyze your prompt and create a detailed project specification.

```bash
mason plan <prompt> # Must be run in the created project root directory
```

> This will create a `specifications.json` file in `spec` directory containing all the instructions and project structures needed to build the project.
